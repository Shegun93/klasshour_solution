For most of the world, Einstein (1879–1955) is a cult figure: the pre-eminent icon of genius. With his wispy, wild grey hair, missing socks and other-worldly idealism, he has replaced the wizards of earlier times in the popular mind. This Einstein is dangerous, a stereotype with a life of its own that distorts both the man behind it and the nature of the science that so shapes our world. Among physicists, Einstein is at times remembered as a grumpy, cutting and arrogant fellow with little patience for family or colleagues. He so annoyed his teachers at university that he failed to secure a job in academia, and had to scramble to find low-paying work in the Swiss patent office (although some say that being Jewish hurt his chances too). During his twenties in Berne, Einstein was a fashionable man about town. His wit and violin playing brought him many dinner invitations, and he formed a reading group with friends to study the work of Kant, Schopenhauer and other philosophers. In 1905, his miracle year, he published several unrelated papers. One was good enough to win a Nobel prize, and another revolutionized our views of space and time. The 25-year-old patent clerk had remade physics in his own image. Einstein’s 1905 theory of space and time is now called the special theory of relativity. The word “relativity” refers to relative speeds and other relations. The theory was “special” in a negative sense: it applied only to a restricted special case and was not general. It has become most well known for predicting that mass can be converted', 'topic': 'Space Time And Einstein'}\n",

As Einstein said: This postulate we call the “special principle of relativity.” The word “special” is meant to intimate that the principle is restricted to the case when the [measuring devices] have a motion of uniform translation . . . and does not extend to the case of non- uniform motion. What is a law of physics? When we plan a journey by car, we all use the simple law that “distance equals speed multiplied by time”: an average of 90 kilometres an hour for five hours will cover 450 kilometres. Here we have a law that connects three things: distance, speed and time. Each of these can easily be measured with, say, the speedometer of the car, a wristwatch and a good map. This suggests that a law is a relation between measurements. The relation in this law is represented by the italicized words above. In every motion, the relation between distance traversed, speed and time taken will be the same. Some laws contain constants. For example, when we drop something to the floor, its speed increases by 9.8 metres per second during every second it falls. Thus, in general, a physical law is a relation, involving constants, between measurement results. Measurements made at different speeds lead to different results. Birds flying alongside a car sometimes seem to stand still: their measured relative speed is zero. But a pedestrian watching the birds swoop by would disagree, and insist that their relative speed was, say, 40 kilometres per hour. The difference between a speed of zero and 40 kilometres per hour reflects the speed of the measurer. Both the driver and the pedestrian, however, will agree that the distance covered by the birds is given by their speed multiplied by the time taken.

While Einstein simply derived these from the principles he assumed, Lorentz insisted that we press more deeply and uncover their causes. He was thus the founding father of what, for our purposes, we will call the minority interpretation. The momentous debate between Einstein and Lorentz pitted two of the greatest physicists against each other. Their respect and affection for one another should not disguise how cutting their disagreement was. Both men had dedicated their lives to physics. If Lorentz proved correct, Einstein’s historic first discovery would be denied him. If Einstein triumphed, Lorentz’s whole approach to physics, his life-work, would be dismissed as old-fashioned, mechanical and metaphysical. Einstein’s mainstream interpretation is dramatic. With a single sweep, it eliminates features of our world that seemed obvious and indispensable, and tumbles us headlong into a new world where distances and durations are not real properties. This has been the dominant view since the triumph of Einstein’s 1905 paper on special relativity. According to the minority interpretation first developed by Lorentz, however, each object does have a definite length of its own, but it varies with speed. That is lengths are real but variable properties of individual bodies. Similarly, an event such as the wink of an eye or a tennis match does have a definite duration, but the duration will dilate or shrink with speed. A tennis match on a large ship will really take longer than the same match would in a court at rest; a moving clock will really run more slowly. Thus the minority interpretation breaks the democracy among inertial measurements. It says that some measurements reveal the real distances and durations, while some instruments are distorted by the effects of their own high speeds and report merely apparent distances and durations.
