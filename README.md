# Klasshour RAGs System 📚🧠

> **Note**: This project is still a work in progress 🚧

## Overview

Klasshour RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation System) is an intelligent learning assistant designed to help students receive **grounded, explainable answers** to their most difficult questions. Built with the needs of students in mind, the system bridges the gap between retrieval and reasoning by providing **context-aware**, **concept-driven**, and **digestible explanations** — not just answers.

## 🧩 Key Features

- ✅ Question understanding using advanced LLMs
- 🔎 Contextual retrieval from domain-specific data (Physics content to start)
- 🧠 Explanation-first philosophy to promote learning, not just solving
- 🚧 Modular notebook structure — easy to follow and extend
- 🌐 Designed for cloud-native deployment (Google Cloud / FastAPI + vLLM)

## 🚀 How It Works (High-Level)

1. **Student inputs a difficult question**
2. **Relevant context** is retrieved from the curated database or document store
3. **A response is generated** by the language model using both the question and retrieved context
4. **The system formats the output** into explainable insights and optionally asks **follow-up diagnostic questions**
