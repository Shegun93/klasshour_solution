# Klasshour RAGs System 

> **Note**: This project is still a work in progress 

## Overview

Klasshour RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation System) is an intelligent learning assistant designed to help students receive grounded, explainable answers to their most difficult questions. Built with the needs of students in mind, the system bridges the gap between retrieval and reasoning by providing 
 - context-aware
 - concept-driven
 - digestible explanations — not just answers.

## Key Features

- Question understanding using advanced LLMs
- Contextual retrieval from domain-specific data (Physics content to start)
- Explanation-first philosophy to promote learning, not just solving
- Designed for cloud-native deployment (Google Cloud / FastAPI + vLLM)

## How It Works (High-Level)

1. Student inputs a difficult question
2. Relevant context is retrieved from the curated database or document store
3. A response is generated by the language model using both the question and retrieved context
4. The system formats the output into explainable insights and optionally asks follow-up diagnostic questions
